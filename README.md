# Decentralized Content Monetization Platform

## Overview

The Decentralized Content Monetization Platform empowers content creators to monetize their work directly without intermediaries taking large platform fees. Writers, artists, musicians, videographers, and other creators can tokenize their content, set up subscription models, sell exclusive access, and receive micropayments from their audience. This creator economy platform enables fans to support their favorite creators through various monetization methods while gaining exclusive perks and early access to new content releases.

## Problem Statement
